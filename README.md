# dbc-student-perf
## üìù Project Description
This project explores the key factors that impact student academic performance using a comprehensive dataset of student records. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns and correlations between exam scores and variables such as gender, attendance, study time, school type, tutoring support, and family income. Specific attention is given to students scoring below 70, with the aim of uncovering actionable insights that can help educators and policymakers support at-risk students more effectively.

## üîß Tools Used: Databricks
The analysis is conducted on Databricks, a powerful cloud-based data analytics platform that combines the capabilities of Apache Spark with collaborative tools for data exploration, visualization, and machine learning. Databricks allows for scalable data processing and seamless integration of notebooks using Python, SQL, and other languages. It enables efficient handling of large datasets and provides built-in support for creating insightful visualizations and sharing findings in real time.
