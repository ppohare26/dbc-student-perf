# dbc-student-perf
## üìù Project Description
This project explores the key factors that impact student academic performance using a comprehensive dataset of student records. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns and correlations between exam scores and variables such as gender, attendance, study time, school type, tutoring support, and family income. Specific attention is given to students scoring below 70, with the aim of uncovering actionable insights that can help educators and policymakers support at-risk students more effectively.

## üîß Tools Used: Databricks
The analysis is conducted on Databricks, a powerful cloud-based data analytics platform that combines the capabilities of Apache Spark with collaborative tools for data exploration, visualization, and machine learning. Databricks allows for scalable data processing and seamless integration of notebooks using Python, SQL, and other languages. It enables efficient handling of large datasets and provides built-in support for creating insightful visualizations and sharing findings in real time.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Conclusion
The analysis reveals several key factors that are associated with lower academic performance among students. A significant portion of students who studied less than 24 hours per week and received limited or no tutoring support scored below 70, highlighting the importance of consistent study habits and academic guidance. Additionally, poor attendance, specifically below 80%, is strongly linked to lower exam scores, emphasizing the need for regular classroom engagement. Lastly, students from medium to low income families attending public schools were more likely to perform poorly, suggesting that socioeconomic factors and school resources play a critical role in academic success. These findings can inform targeted interventions to support underperforming student groups.
